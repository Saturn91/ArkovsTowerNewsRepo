#Releasing the Prologue

(March 22, 2024)

Today, I'm excited to release the prologue! It includes three levels and a final boss, all of which can be conquered across three difficulty settings. If you encounter any bugs or inconsistencies, I eagerly await your feedback and bug reports via Steam posts.

Once you've completed the three levels, look forward to the next content update in two weeks, where I'll be adding another three levels. And for those who are still craving more, I highly recommend exploring the Modding Menu.

Currently, you can modify all texts, graphics, and configurations. The full version, coming in June, will also support Lua scripting.

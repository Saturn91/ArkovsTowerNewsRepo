Special Characteres update

Spent the last two days with something english speaker do not have to worry about that much. Special characters :D. You know the strange chars like äöü wich non english speakers tend to use in their languages. Its a lot of fun to implement (oh I hate/love polishing). Anyway I made it and also added mod support to it. So technically a localization into japanese, chinese and the like is no possible. And yes if you want to, you can do it yourself using my simple modding tools.
Next Step "recordings for the trailer"

#Polishing and Testing

(02/24/2024)

As the title sais, my main topic currenetly is testing and polishing of the final prolog version. I spend most of my time fixing the smaller and bigger bugs reproted by my testers and improving the modding experience.
Don't forget to hop into the discord and say hi :D (link in Mainmenu).

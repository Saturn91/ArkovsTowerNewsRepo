Special Characteres update

Spent the last two days with something english speaker do not have to worry about that much. Special characters :D. You know the strange chars required for non english speakers in their languages. Its a lot of fun to implement (oh I hate/love polishing). Anyway I made it and also added mod support to it. So technically a localization into japanese, chinese and the like is now possible. And yes if you want to, you can do it yourself using my simple modding tools.
